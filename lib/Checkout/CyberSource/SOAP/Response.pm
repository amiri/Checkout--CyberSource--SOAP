=head1 NAME

Checkout::CyberSource::SOAP::Response

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $response = $c->model('Checkout')->checkout( $c->req->params );

    When you call Checkout::CyberSource::SOAP::process, your response object
    is a Checkout::CyberSource::SOAP::Response.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item respond

This basically just maps response codes from Checkout::CyberSource::SOAP to a
function returning success or failure--there are many ways to fail, thus most
of the entries in the dispatch table.
