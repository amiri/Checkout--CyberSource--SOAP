=head1 NAME

Checkout::CyberSource::SOAP

=head2 WHAT? 

A Modern Perl interface to CyberSource's
SOAP API.

=head1 WHY?

Folks often have a need for simple and quick, but "enterprise-level" payment-
gateway integration. CyberSource's Simple Order API still requires that you
compile a binary, and it won't compile on 64-bit processors (no, not OSes, but
processors, i.e., what I imagine to be most development workstations by now).
So you have to use the SOAP API, which is unwieldy, not least because it uses
XML. May no one struggle with this again.  :)

=head1 NOTICE

=head2 Credit Card Numbers

To save you some legal hassles and vulnerability, this module does not store
credit card numbers. If you'd like the option of returning a credit card
number from the Response object, please send a patch.

=head2 ID and Key

Please note that you B<must> use your own CyberSource id and key, even for
testing purposes on CyberSource's test server. This module defaults to
using the test server, so when you go into production, set production to
a true value in your configuration file or in your object construction, e.g.,
    
    my $checkout = Checkout::CyberSource::SOAP->new(
        id         => $id,
        key        => $key,
        production => 1,
        column_map => $column_map
    );

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This is for single transactions of variable quantity.

B<column_map> is important. You B<must> map the keys in the hashref you send
(which also sets the keys for the payment_info hashref you receive back).
CyberSource uses camelCased and otherwise idiosyncratic identifiers here, so
this mapping cannot be avoided.

I mentioned above that this module does not store credit card numbers; more
specifically, the payment_info hash that the Response object returns deletes
the credit card number, replaces it with card_type, and adds 4 additional keys:

    decision fault reasoncode refcode

These are for more a detailed record of why a particular transaction was denied.

=head2 Standalone Usage

You can use this as a standalone module by sending it a payment information
hashref. You will receive a Checkout::CyberSource::SOAP::Response object
containing either a success message or an error message. If successful, you
will also receive a payment_info hashref, suitable for storing in your
database.

    my $checkout = Checkout::CyberSource::SOAP->new(
        id         => $id,
        key        => $key,
        column_map => $column_map
    );

    ...

    my $response = $checkout->checkout($args);

    ...

    if ($response->success) {
        my $payment_info = $response->payment_info;
        # Store payment_info in your database, etc.
    }
    else {
        # Display error message
        print $response->error->{message};
    }


=head2 Catalyst

You can use this in a Catalyst application by using L<Catalyst::Model::Adaptor>
and setting your configuration file somewhat like this:

    <Model::Checkout>
        class   Checkout::CyberSource::SOAP
        <args>
            id  your_cybersource_id
            key your cybersource_key
            #production  1
            <column_map>
                firstName		firstname
                lastName		lastname
                street1		    address1
                city    		city
                state	    	state
                postalCode	    zip
                country         country
                email           email
                ipAddress		ip
                unitPrice		amount
                quantity		quantity
                currency		currency
                accountNumber	cardnumber
                expirationMonth	expiry.month
                expirationYear	expiry.year
            </column_map>
        </args>
    </Model::Checkout>

production is commented out. You will want to set production to true when you
are ready to process real transactions. So that in your payment processing
controller you would get validated data back from a shopping cart or other
form and do something like this:
    
    # If your checkout form is valid, call Checkout::CyberSource::SOAP's
    # checkout method:

    my $response = $c->model('Checkout')->checkout( $c->req->params );

    # Check the Checkout::CyberSource::SOAP::Response object, branch
    # accordingly.

    if ( $response->success ) {

        # Store a payment in your database

        my $payment = $c->model('Payment')->create($response->payment_info);

        $c->flash( status_msg => $response->success->{message} );
        $c->res->redirect($c->uri_for('I_got_your_money'));
    }
    
    else {
        $c->stash( error_msg => $response->error->{message} );
        return;
    }
